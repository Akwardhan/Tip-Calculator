Hi There, I created a simple Tip-Calculator while learning about f-string, and basic mathematical computation.

I took the input from the user about the total bill before the concatenation of the percentage with the total bill. Using mathematical computation, calculated the percentage 
and added to the final bill.

And then if we want to know how much each person should pay, we need the number of persons between whom the bill is to be split,
so we get the bill each person should pay.

And at the end, created the exe file using Pyinstaller.
